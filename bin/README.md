## Installation

Installer will install `dotfiles` program globally in your system, that you can
use it wherever you like.

> Don't be afraid, **installation process won't remove any of your previous
> configurations**. It will only save them all, simply by renaming files with
> current date.

If you want to agree to all defaults add `-y` flag at the end of install.

```shell
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/egel/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
$ ~/.dotfiles/bin/dotfiles install
```

When you pass through the installation, you should have `dotfiles` program
globally installed, then run:

```shell
$ dotfiles clean-all
$ dotfiles reconfigur
```

The last thing you should do is to set [`Hack font`][hack-font-webpage] as
default `terminal` font. This is essential to correctly display
a powerline fonts which are already included into the Hack font (Read
[FAQ][docs-faq] for more).

Reopen the terminal and enjoy.
